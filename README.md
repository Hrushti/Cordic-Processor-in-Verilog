# CORDIC Processor
âš¡ Cordic (Volder's algorithm) is an iterative method to compute a wide range of mathematical functions. It stands for COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer. 
## Project overview:
* Implementation of trigonomtric and logarithmic functions using the CORDIC algorithm in Python (to get a clear understanding of the algo) and in Verilog.
* Using the sine and cosine implementation to design modules for DFT (discrete Fourier Transform) and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).
* Implementing a string-matching algorithm.
